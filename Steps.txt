## Pre-Processing : 

#1: Grab The Data
#2: Separate the Data into Dependant and Independent Variables
#3: Deal with Missing values (Impute/Drop) 
#4: Deal with outliers (Impute/Drop)
#5: Check Co-relation between data and multicollinearity
#6: Encode Non-Numeric categorical Data
#7: Check Class Imbalance, Rare Values, High Values, Extreme Values, Linear values and Outliers
#8: Eliminate the Non Influencing factors (independent variables)
#9: Feature Scale
#10: Apply Dimensionality Reduction (if required)

## Build and Run the Model

#10: Divide the data into training and testing data
#11: Build the Model. Check the Co-Efficient and the Intercepts
#12: Run it on Training Set. Capture the accuracy/Error
#13: Run The Model on Test Data. Capture Error and determine the performance of the model
#14: Check Bias and variance
#15: Run it on K-Fold Test. Re-Check Bias and Variance.

## Tune The Model
#16: Tune the Hyperparameters of the algorithm for satisfactory accuracy
#17: Interpret the Results
